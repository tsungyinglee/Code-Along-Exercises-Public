## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
#| echo: false
```


## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: example
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| label: example-2
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#| label: example-3

```

```{r}
#| label: example-4
```

```{r}

```


```{r}

```
