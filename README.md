## Structure

The repository is organized into course-specific and textbook-specific directories:

### File Organization
- **Course directories** follow module-based organization (M1, M2, etc.)
- **Project files** include RStudio project files (`.Rproj`) for R-based work
- **Quarto documents** (`.qmd`) for reproducible research and reports
- **R scripts** (`.r`) for data analysis and visualization
- **Jupyter notebooks** (`.ipynb`) for Python-based analysis
- **SQL files** (`.sql`) for database exercises and queries
- **Rendered outputs** (`.html`, `.pdf`) from Quarto and Jupyter notebooks
- **Supporting files** include bibliographies (`references.bib`), datasets (`.xlsx`), and configuration files

### Key Features
- **Reproducible Research**: Extensive use of Quarto for combining code, text, and outputs
- **Multi-language Support**: Projects spanning R, Python, and SQL
- **Version Control**: Git integration with proper `.gitignore` configurations
- **Development Environment**: VS Code and dev container setup for consistent development experience

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A learning portfolio documenting my progress through various data science courses
- A reference collection of code examples and best practices
- Practice exercises for R, Python, SQL, and data visualization
- Examples of reproducible research using Quarto and Jupyter notebooks

## Tools and Technologies

- **R** with RStudio, ggplot2, and tidyverse ecosystem
- **Python** with Jupyter notebooks and data analysis libraries
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL) for database operations and analytics
- **Quarto** for reproducible research and multi-format publishing
- **Data Visualization** with ggplot2, matplotlib, and other visualization libraries
- **VS Code** with dev containers for integrated development environment
- **Git** for version control and project management
